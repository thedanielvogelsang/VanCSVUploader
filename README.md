This application was designed for a local senate campaign, intending to be a tool for the candidate's campaign to use for fast uploads to VAN VoteBuilder, an online database used by the Democratic Party across the United States. In our instance, my candidate was using her campaign website as a location for volunteer signups and campaign-related surveys. However, the website was built on Wordpress, and did not provide any easy way to transfer form data to her more-official campaign database: VAN. This app aims to bridge that gap, and required me to investigate several new technologies, including: XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX

Combining my political interests with my new-found skills, the problem presented a fun challenge for my Capstone project, and the result is this application:

Simple to use and replicable, VanCSVUploader uses a simple drag-and-drop system for CSV uploads, and then leaves the work to the app. While VanCSVUploader depends on synching the parser to survey questions, it is adaptable. Future adaptions could include a way for the admin to update survey questions internally. Feel free to put in a PullRequest!
